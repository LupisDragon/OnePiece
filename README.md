# OnePiece
A LttP rando setting I came up with

This is a setting I came up with for the LttP randomizer, available at https://alttpr.com/en/randomizer

Goal: There is one triforce piece hidden somewhere, find it, and turn it in. I'd like to create a hack to convert the triforce piece into the triforce, creating the instant win, without needing to turn it in.

No knowledge of glitches or dark rooms is required.<br>
--NOTE: This can result in super-short seeds--

Settings- <br>
  Item Placement: Advanced<br>
  Logic: Beatable<br>
  GT Access: random<br>
  Ganon: 7 crystals<br>
  World State: Open<br>
  Swords: Randomized<br>
  Boss Shuffle: None<br>

Some of the more complexities-<br>
  Maps, compasses, and big keys are shuffled outside of dungeons. There is currently no text telling you what you've picked up, but the menu is available, so you can see what you got.<br>
  Small keys have been converted to generic keys, and are shuffled outside of the dungeons.<br>
  All heart pieces and normal heart containers have been replaced with Santuary Heart Containers. Rupees have been added to the pool to make up for resulting deficiencies.<br>
  The single arrow drop was replaced with the triforce piece.<br>
